				<h2>‚ÄúWhen done well, software is invisible.‚Äù<sup>1</sup></h2>
			</header>
			<p>Ever since I was a little boy, due to an innate curiosity about how things work, building electric
				circuits with lamps, motors and LEDs and inventing things empowered my constant drive to learn,
				experiment, and create.<br />
				Then it all started when I was exposed to PHP & MySQL and built a Pentium-II tower server running Red
				Hat 5 to host my first web projects (#nerdalert I had even built a PCB with a thermal sensor that was
				controlling 2 external fans when temperature was high ü§ì). Today, after almost 20 years of growing
				through a career that took me to
				the SysAdmin / SysOps / Management world, acquiring experience in several IT domains, I started a
				journey to recover one of my passions: <b>software engineering</b>. </p>

				Due to my inclination toward the world of electronics and technology, I decided to avoid a traditional
				secondary education. I went to a technical school to grade with a specialization in electronics (or, as
				they say, an electronics technician). Thanks to the specific curricula, I got exposed to different
				programming languages from the beginning (even programming low-level PLCs). <br /><br />
				After grading secondary school, I took a year off to develop a startup with two other friends from the
				technical school: STB Networks (or <i><a
						href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030421220513/http://www.stbnetworks.com/es/index.php?module=la+empresa"
						target="new">Santa
						Teresita Beach Networks</a></i>, being Santa Teresita, the beach
				where we spent our summers as teenagers).
				We developed websites using Dreamweaver (including Macromedia Flash) and resold hosting plans.
				After two years, life took us on different paths. I got my first job as a Backend Software Developer,
				working
				with PHP and MySQL initially, and after including some Frontend coding some basic games done in
				Macromedia Flash with
				Actionscript. (the trendy "Full-stack" roles didn't exist back then üôÇ)
				<br /><br />
				Recommendations from people I knew got me into a change where I forked my career into the SysAdmin
				world. I continued to develop some scripts here and there, but now I was administering Windows image
				deployment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Installation_Services" target="new">RIS</a>,
				anyone?), which then took me to complex architectures, mobile gateway deployments for
				MS Exchange, etc.
				<br /><br />
				After a few years, I started looking for a change, and after being recommended by a colleague, I started
				my
				journey working in the "big leagues" with Avaya. I participated in the development from the ground up of
				a technical support team as a support engineer, troubleshooting complex customer environments composed
				of intertwined interactions between windows hosts, Linux hosts, and PBXs (including PostgreSQL databases
				and JTAPI applications). During this time, I experienced exponential growth in terms of technical
				knowledge. I also continued to do some shell scripting to automate routine tasks such as log
				collection and extraction from remote systems.
				<br /><br />
				The team experience and dynamics got me to my first technical leadership role. I continued to perform
				technical support activities and trained newcomers to get them up to speed.
				Unfortunately, the company decided to close the office to move operations to another country.

				<br /><br />
				I profited the time off to finish my Bachelor's of Science in Information Systems and then joined an
				airline company as
				an IT Operations Manager. From here onwards, my career took me into the Management world.
				Besides focusing on managerial tasks, I always found a spot to keep my "hands dirty." During this
				experience, I virtualized around 20 legacy servers running core services and many business applications
				with VMWare and built a parallel staging/prod cluster with XenServer for our Dev team.
				<br /><br />
				In parallel, my wife received an offer to move to Switzerland, and we decided to go for it. I had to
				leave my job and get out to the Swiss market to find new challenges and opportunities to continue
				growing.<br />
				While searching, I worked for a few months with two new friends to help them out with their food
				delivery business. I profited and developed an online stock management solution with Google Apps Script
				(including recipe calculations, an auto PO generator based on the ingredients yield and email reporting,
				quality control for expiration dates, etc.). I then migrated the logic of the app into a fully fledged
				Backoffice website, using CakePHP/MySQL and bootstrap.
				<br /><br />
				After a few months, I started working as a Customer Support & IT Ops manager on a swiss startup. I grew
				the Support Team globally, implementing new technologies and infrastructure to support business needs.
				Lately, I decided to go for a career change and take over a Senior manager role for different teams that
				operate
				cloud platforms.
				<br /><br />
				Oh yes! and I forgot. I'm originally from Argentina and speak Spanish, English, French, and Italian.
